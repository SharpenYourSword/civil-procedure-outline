\section{Jurisdiction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Territorial jurisdiction: jurisdiction over cases arising in or involving persons residing within a defined territory.
    \item Personal jurisdiction: a court's power to bring a person into its adjudicative process.
    \item Subject matter jurisdiction: the court's power to decide a particular type of case.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\emph{Pennoyer}: Personal Jurisdiction and Territorial Power}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item  In an in personam case, does service by publication to a non-resident defendant establish territorial jurisdiction? \emph{Pennoyer v. Neff}:
Mitchell sues Neff in Oregon state trial court for nonpayment of legal fees rendered in 1862-1863. Neff is nowhere to be found, so Mitchell publishes notice of the suit in a newspaper. Neff does not appear, so the court orders a default judgment. The property is attached and then sold to Mitchell, who sells it to Pennoyer. Eight years later, Neff successfully sues Pennoyer to recover the property. The court (Justice Field) relies on an analytical framework in which the basis for jurisdiction is a state's territorial power. States are all-powerful within their borders, and powerless beyond. It holds that service by publication isn't good enough for in personam suits against a non-resident (though it might be good enough for in rem suits). Thus, the original judgment against Neff was void.
    \item Doctrine of \textbf{collateral attack: a judgment void when rendered is void forever.}
    \item Collateral estoppel: binding effect of a judgment on later controversies involving a different claim from that on which the original judgment was based.
    \item The Due Process Clause (Fourteenth Amendment) governs personal jurisdiction.
    \item In \emph{Pennoyer}, personal jurisdiction is based on territorial power. States are all-powerful within their borders and powerless without.
    \item Who benefits from updates to \emph{Pennoyer}?
    \item \emph{Milliken v. Meyer}: domicile alone within a state is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\emph{Hess}: Jurisdiction Over Out-of-State Drivers}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can a state implement a statute that requires out-of-state drivers to give implied consent to jurisdiction within that state? \textbf{\emph{Hess v. Pawloski}} Plaintiff, a Pennsylvania resident, ``negligently and wantonly drove a motor vehicle on a public highway in Massachusetts,'' causing injury to the defendant. In a MA Superior Court, plaintiff contested MA's jurisdiction, which was denied. The Supreme Judicial Court upheld the order. Plaintiff appealed to the Supreme Court on Fourteenth Amendment grounds. The court reasoned that earlier cases (e.g., \emph{Kane v. New Jersey}) have upheld the constitutionality of statutes that require out-of-state drivers to appoint an agent to receive process before using the highway. States can legitimately require to appoint similar agent implicitly, and these kinds of statutes do not not constitute discrimination against non-residents. Therefore, it is consistent with the Due Process Clause for states to require out-of-state drivers to implicitly appoint an agent to receive process, thereby establishing jurisdiction over those drivers if civil actions arise.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\emph{International Shoe}: ``Minimum Contacts''}

\textbf{"But now that the capias ad respondendum has given way to personal service of summons or other form of notice, due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within the territory of the forum, he have certain minimum contacts with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend `traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.'"}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Can a state have jurisdiction over an entity if the entity does not have a permanent presence within the state? What constitutes the necessary contact to establish jurisdiction? \textbf{\emph{International Shoe Co. v. Washington}}: The State of Washington sued International Shoe to recover unpaid contributions to the state unemployment compensation fund. Justice Stone wrote the opinion.

    International Shoe argued first that the Washington statute imposes an unconstitutional burden on interstate commerce. The court rejected this on the basis that ``it is no longer debatable'' that the commerce clause gives Congress broad power to regulate interstate commerce.

    Second, it argued that merely soliciting orders within a state ``does not render the seller amenable to suit within the state.'' The court notes that historically, physical presence within a state is a prerequisite for jurisdiction in in personam cases (\emph{Pennoyer}). But now, \textbf{minimum contacts} are sufficient. ``Presence'' is a symbolic term that can refer to business activities within a territory; in other words, it can refer to activities that give rise to the liabilities at issue in the suit. Moreover, since an entity enjoys certain benefits and protections from a state's laws, it also has an obligation to that state.

    The court held that Washington is entitled to recover the unpaid contributions.

\emph{...due process requires only that in order to subject a defendant to a judgment in personam, if he be not present within theterritory of the forum, he have certain \textbf{minimum contacts} with it such that the maintenance of the suit does not offend \textbf{``traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice.''}}\footnote{Casebook p. 179.}
    \item Justice Black, concurring: States have a constitutional power to tax and sue corporations that due business in the state's territory. The test of ``fair play and substantial justice'' is ``confusing'' and gives the court the unwarranted power to strike down any legislation it might see as violating ``natural justice.''
    \item Unlike in \emph{Pennoyer}, \emph{in personam} jurisdiction is based on ``minimum contacts,'' not territorial principles.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{General and Specific Jurisdiction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item \textbf{General jurisdiction}: The defendant has substantial enough contacts with a state that any dispute can be litigated in that state, regardless of whether the dispute arises from those contacts.
    \item \textbf{Specific jurisdiction}: Contacts to the forum are related to the specific dispute.
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{\emph{World-Wide}: Jurisdiction Over Out-of-State Car Dealers}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does selling a car in one state constitute the necessary minimum contact (under the \emph{Shoe} test) to establish \emph{in personam} jurisdiction over the seller in another state?\textbf{\emph{World-Wide Volkswagen Corp. v. Woodson}}: The Robinsons purchased an Audi in New York. It caught fire in an accident in Oklahoma.    
    \item Justice White: To establish jurisdiction, defendants must have minimum contacts, and the contacts must not violate ``traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice'' (forum State's interest in adjudicating the dispute; convenient venue for plaintiff; interstate judicial system's interest in efficient resolution; and shared interest in fundamental policy goals). Jurisdictional rules have been relaxed, but the Constitution nonetheless privileges state sovereignty. ``Petitioners (World-Wide and Seaway) carry on no activity whatsoever in Oklahoma.'' Petitioners could not reasonably predict being haled into court in OK. Corporations can ``purposely avail'' themselves of the benefits of conducting activity in the forum state---but there is no such availment here. No contacts, so no jurisdiction.
    \item Justice Brennan, dissenting: The Court reads \emph{Shoe} too narrowly. The seller and dealer purposefully injected their product ``into the stream of interstate commerce,'' thus establishing minimum contact.
    \item Justices Marshall and Blackmun, dissenting: The dealer and seller chose to become part of a global marketing and servicing network. Cars derive their value from being mobile. The dealer and seller received economic advantage from the ability to draw revenue from Oklahoma.
    \item Justice Blackmun, dissenting: Confusing why the distributor and seller are getting sued here. Also, cars are mobile by nature.
    \item Questions from Bradt:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Who are the defendants in the case, and which defendants are challenging personal jurisdiction? What is the basis of jurisdiction for the defendants who are not so challenging?
        \item In what states do you think the Robinsons could sue defendants over whom the Oklahoma courts do not have jurisdiction?
        \item Note on page 192 Justice White's statement that even if the forum the plaintiff has chosen will not be abusive to the defendant, the Due Process Clause may bar the plaintiff's choice ``acting as an instrument of interstate federalism.''  Is this consistent with International Shoe?  And what do you think of this statement after reading Burger King?  Should federalism play any role here?
        \item Pay close attention to Justice White's discussion of ``purposeful availment'' on page 194, and Justice Marshall's dissent on that point on pages 197--198. Who has the better of the argument?  Do you think Worldwide and Seaway should have been subject to jurisdiction in Oklahoma in this case?

    \item Rudzewicz fails to show that jurisdiction would be fundamentally unfair.
    \item Justice Stevens, dissenting: it's fundamentally unfair to require a franchisee to submit to the jurisdiction of the franchiser.
    \item Questions from Bradt:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is this a case of specific jurisdiction or general jurisdiction?
        \item How did Rudzewicz ``purposefully direct'' his activities toward Florida? Are you persuaded that his actions justify Florida's exercise of jurisdiction over him?
        \item Who has the better of the argument as to whether it's fundamentally fair to subject Rudzewicz to jurisdiction in Florida, Justice Brennan or Justice Stevens?
        \item Why did Seaway and Worldwide VW benefit from the protections of the Due Process Clause while Mr. Rudzewicz didn't? The Court seems to make a lot of Mr. Rudzewicz's business sophistication and the benefits he received from participation in the national market---why weren't those factors persuasive in Volkswagen? Is the work that purposeful availment's doing here justified? (Note that two justices (Burger and Rehnquist) thought that there was no jurisdiction in VW but that there was in BK, and Justice O'Connor (who was on the Court for BK, but not VW), thought there was jurisdiction in BK despite that VW was a controlling opinion.)

The Court, per Justice Ginsburg, defines general jurisdiction as where the defendant is ''essentially at home.'' According to Justice Ginsburg, what are the ``paradigm places'' where the defendant is ``at home''?
        \item What provision of the North Carolina long-arm statute did the plaintiffs rely on in order to obtain personal jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiaries?
        \item Goodyear USA (the parent corporation) consented to the North Carolina court's jurisdiction over it. Could Goodyear USA, which is based and incorporated in Ohio, have successfully challenged personal jurisdiction in North Carolina? Was there ``general jurisdiction'' over Goodyear in North Carolina? Specific jurisdiction?
        \item The Court notes that some of the foreign subsidiaries' tires made their way to North Carolina (to be used on horse trailers, etc.)? Let's say one of those tires allegedly caused an accident in North Carolina? Do you think there would be specific jurisdiction over the foreign subsidiaries in that case?

    \item Bradt on \textbf{\emph{Calder v. Jones}}: California actress Shirley Jones (of ``Partridge Family'' fame) sued the National Enquirer for libel based on a story it published essentially calling her a drunk.  Jones sued in California state court.  The Enquirer, which is based in Florida, contested jurisdiction on the ground that it did not have minimum contacts with California.  The reporter had only gone to CA once, and everything else was essentially done in Florida.  The Supreme Court held that there \emph{was} personal jurisdiction over the Enquirer in California on the ground that it ``expressly aimed'' its conduct toward California.  This is an interesting spin on purposeful availment commonly referred to as the ``effects test''---if a defendant commits an intentional tort aimed at the forum state and causes harm in the forum state, there is specific jurisdiction over the defendant in cases arising out of that harm in the forum state.  In \emph{Calder}, the Court found that the Enquirer had aimed its conduct at California because (a) it knew that's where Jones lived and worked and would therefore suffer the brunt of the injury, and (b) because California was the largest state for circulation of the Enquirer, so it knew the harm in that state would be significant.

    \item Long-arm statutes enable states to assert jurisdiction beyond their borders.
    \item Some extend jurisdiction to the full extent that the Constitution allows. Others specify the circumstances in which states can extend jurisidiction.
    \item Detailed long-arm statutes can make the law more predictable.
    \item Federal courts usually follow the long-arm statutes of the states in which they sit.
    \item If the state long-arm statute does not extend to the full constitutional limits of in personam jurisdiction, the only question before the court is statutory (e.g., in \emph{Bensusan}, below).

\subsection{\emph{Bensusan}: Online Activity}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Does New York have jurisdiction over an out-of-state defendant because of his online activities? \textbf{\emph{Bensusan Restaurant Corp. v. King}}: Bensusan and King both own cabarets in New York City and Columbia, MO, respectively. King build a website, and Bensusan sues for compensatory damages, punitive damages, costs, attorney's fees, and to enjoin King from using the name ``Blue Note.'' The New York long-arm statute (N.Y.C.P.L.R. § 320(a)) requires that the defendant must have been physically present in the state when he committed the act. The court finds that King was not physically present, and does not meet any of the other statutory requirements for jurisdiction.
    \item Federal court cannot be an authoritative source of state law---it can only infer what New York courts would do in a comparable case.
    \item In \emph{Inset Systems, Inc. v. Instruction Set, Inc.}, a Connecticut district court held that advertising online could potentially reach ``as many as 10,000 Internet users within Connecticut'' and is ``continuously available.'' Therefore, the advertiser has ``purposefully availed itself of the privileges of doing business in Connecticut.''
    \item In \emph{Zippo Manufacturing Co. v. Zippo Dot Com, Inc.}, Zippo (the lighter company) sued Zippo (the publishing company). The Pennsylvania district court established the Zippo test for determining jurisdiction in Internet cases. The test relies on a scale of commercial activity. On one side of the scale are sites that exists exclusively to do business online. If a defendant knowingly enters into a contract with residents of a foreign jurisdiction, then personal jurisdiction is proper. On the other side of the scale are sites that passively post information. Personal jurisdiction cannot be asserted for those sites. In the middle are sites in which the user can exchange information with a host computer. In those cases, the ``level of interaction'' and the ``commercial nature of the exchange'' are the basis for determining the exercise of jurisdiction.

\subsection{\emph{Shaffer v. Heitner}}

Should \emph{quasi in rem} proceedings be based on the \emph{Pennoyer}
framework of territorial power (which would allow jurisdiction) or the
\emph{International Shoe} framework of minimum contacts consistent with
traditional notions of fair play and substantial justice (which might
not)?

Heitner, the respondent, owned one share of stock in Greyhound Corp., a
Delaware corporation with its primary place of business in Phoenix.
Heitner originally sued 28 of its officers and directors for damages in
a case involving antitrust and criminal contempt violations in Oregon.
Under a Delaware statute, he filed for an order of sequestration against
the property of the officers. The property consisted of Greyhound
options and 82,000 shares of common stock. The defendants (here,
appellants) argue that the sequestration statute did not accord due
process of law and that the property seized could not be attached in
Delaware. Deleware courts rejected this jurisdictional challenge.

Justice Marshall:
\begin{enumerate}
\item
  \emph{Quasi in rem} jurisdiction has traditionally been based on
  physical presence, not minimum contacts (\emph{Pennoyer}).
\item
  The \emph{Pennoyer} framework included a few exceptions (marriage,
  foreign corporations doing business in a state, etc.).
\item
  Modern realities expanded the \emph{Pennoyer} framework (e.g.,
  \emph{Hess}) without fundamentally changing it.
\item
  The \emph{International Shoe} framework supplanted \emph{Pennoyer} for
  \emph{in personam} cases. No similar conceptual revision has occurred
  for \emph{in rem} cases, though lower courts have moved strongly in
  that direction.
\item
  Key break from \emph{Pennoyer}: asserting jurisdiction over a thing is
  a ``customarily elliptical way'' of asserting jurisdiction over the
  interests of a person in a thing.
\item
  \emph{Pennoyer} led to odd situations where property serves as the
  basis for jurisdiction in causes of action that are completely
  unrelated to the property (like the present case). It is illogical,
  though \emph{Pennoyer} permits it, to assert jurisdiction indirectly,
  via property, if direct assertion of personal jurisdiction would not
  be allowed.
\item
  There are no good historical reasons to cling to \emph{Pennoyer}.
\item
  We should therefore use the \emph{International Shoe} test for all
  assertions of state court jurisdiction.
\item
  Appellants' holdings do not constitute minimum contacts with
  Delaware--thus, Delaware does not have jurisdiction.
\end{enumerate}

Justice Powell, concurring:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Property that is ``indisputably and permanently'' within a state
  (e.g., real estate) might pass the \emph{International Shoe} test. The
  court should reserve judgment on that issue.
\end{enumerate}

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Fair notice requires warning that a particular activity will open the
  actor to the jurisdiction of a foreign sovereign. Buying stock
  includes no such warning.
\item
  Agree with Powell.
\item
  There are other longstanding methods of asserting jurisdiction based
  on territory that should not be discounted.
\end{enumerate}

Justice Brennan, concurring in part and dissenting in part:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  Delaware explicitly did not enact a law basing \emph{quasi in rem}
  jurisdiction over shareholders on a minimum contacts test. For the
  court to invalidate this imaginary statute is a pure ``advisory
  opinion.''
\end{enumerate}

The court unanimously (sans Rehnquist) held that Delaware did not have
jurisdiction over the defendants. The Delaware Supreme Court ruling was
reversed.

Rule: Jurisdiction in \emph{quasi in rem} actions must be based on the minimum
contacts test (\emph{International Shoe}), not the territorial power
framework (\emph{Pennoyer}).

\subsection{\emph{Burnham v. Superior Court of Calif.}}

Is a person's mere presence within a state sufficient to establish that
state's jurisdiction over that person?

The petitioner, Burnham, and his wife decided to separate. Before his
wife moved to California, the couple agreed to divorce on grounds of
``irreconcilable differences.'' After she left, however, the petitioner
filed for divorce on grounds of ``desertion.'' His wife brought suit in
California. Some months later, the petitioner was on a business trip in
California, where he was served with court summons and a divorce
petition.

Petitioner filed a motion to quash on the argument that his brief
contacts with California did not meet the requirements to establish
jurisdiction. The Superior Court denied the motion and the Court of
Appeal denied mandamus relief.

Justice Scalia:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The question is whether physical presence is enough to establish
  jurisdiction, or whether the person must also have minimum contacts.
\item
  There has never been a case that suggests in-state service is
  insufficient to establish personal jurisdiction.
\item
  \emph{Pennoyer} broadened over the 20th century; \emph{International
  Shoe} established a different standard.
\item
  The petitioner seeks to establish that presence in the forum state is
  no longer sufficient to establish jurisdiction. This is entirely
  wrong. The \emph{International Shoe} test was developed by analogy to
  the ``physical presence'' test, and it would be ``perverse'' to use
  the \emph{Shoe} test to undermine it.
\item
  \emph{Shaffer} involved an absent defendant, and it held that the
  defendant's contacts must include property related to the litigation
  to establish jurisdiction (or, in a different light, that \emph{quasi
  in rem} and \emph{in personam} are really one and the same). There is
  no absent defendant in the present case.
\item
  In response to Brennan's concurrence: (1) Brennan proposes a standard
  based on ``contemporary notions of due process''---but this is
  hopelessly subjective. (2) Brennan argues that the concept of
  transient jurisdiction---of presence within a state creating a
  ``reasonable expectation'' of being subject to suit--is based on
  fairness. Really, though, it's based on the same traditions that
  Brennan tries to dismiss. ``Justice Brennan's long journey is a
  circular one.''
\end{enumerate}

Justice White, concurring in part:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  It would be unworkable to decide in each case whether service was
  delivered fairly. The rule should stand as-is.
\end{enumerate}

Justice Brennan, concurring in the judgment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  A rule does not comport with due process simply because of its
  pedigree.
\item
  \emph{Shaffer} established that all rules, regardless of pedigree,
  must comport with modern understandings of due process.
\item
  More than a century of the rule's existence gives defendants ample
  notice that their presence within a state can subject them to that
  state's jurisdiction.
\item
  By visiting a state, a defendant avails himself of that state's
  benefits. Without the transient jurisdiction rule, the actor would
  have the full benefit of access to the state's courts as a plaintiff
  while remaining immune from the same courts' jurisdiction. This
  asymmetry would be unfair.
\end{enumerate}

Justice Stevens, concurring in the judgment:

\begin{enumerate}
\item
  The other justices' opinions are overly broad {[}though he doesn't say
  how{]}.
\end{enumerate}

The Superior Court's ruling is affirmed.

Rule: presence within a state is sufficient to establish jurisdiction.

\subsubsection{\emph{Mullance v. Central Hanover Bank \& Trust}}

\textbf{``An elementary and fundamental requirement of due process in any proceeding which is to be accorded finality is notice reasonably calculated, under all the circumstances, to apprise interested parties of the pendency of the action and afford them an opportunity to present their objections.''}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item A New York law required a judicial settlement of a common trust fund. In strict compliance with the statute, the Central Hanover Bank and Trust gave notice to beneficiaries by publication in a local newspaper. Does the NY statute requiring, at a minimum, notice by publication for trust beneficiaries violate the Fourteenth Amendment?
    \item The NY Court of Appeals overruled objections that notice by publication here violates the Fourteenth Amendment.
    \item Justice Jackson:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item The only notice to beneficiaries appeared in a local newspaper, in strict compliance with the NY statute.
        \item At the time of the first investment, the trust had contacted each person by mail.
        \item It doesn't matter whether this proceeding is \emph{in rem}, \emph{quasi in rem}, or \emph{in personam}. In all cases, courts have the right to protect claimants' rights to notice and hearing and determine claimants' interests.
        \item There's not much precedent here.
        \item Notice by publication is chancy at best compared to notice in person---``we are unable to regard this as more than a feint.''
        \item It's not necessary to put huge effort into finding unknown claimants. Notice by publication is fine if it's not reasonably easy to make contact.
        \item For parties with known contact information, notice by mail is the minimum requirement. The NY statute requiring a minimum of notice by publication in all cases is unconstitutional.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The notice requirements in the New York statute are unconstitutional. Judgment for the appellant (Mullane).
    \item Rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
       \item  The constitutionality of the method of service is independent from the classification of the cause of action as \emph{in rem}, \emph{quasi in rem}, or \emph{in personam}.
        \item If it's easy to serve notice by mail or in person, notice by publication does not satisfy due process requirements.

\begin{enumerate}
    \item When notice of a tax sale is returned undelivered, is the government
    required to take additional reasonable steps to satisfy the Due Process
    Clause?
    \item The plaintiff, Jones, was delinquent on his property taxes. The state
    sent two certified letters to his address over the course of two years,
    both of which were returned as ``unclaimed.'' Just before the property
    was to be auctioned, the state also published a notice of public sale in
    a newspaper. The house was sold to Flowers.
    \item The trial court granted summary judgment in favor of the defendants (the
    Commissioner and Flowers). The Arkansas Supreme Court affirmed.
    \item Justice Roberts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Due process does not require that the property owner receive actual
          notice, but it does require a reasonable attempt (\emph{Mullane}).
        \item A person who actually wanted to inform someone about an impending tax
          sale would surely take extra steps if a certified letter of notice was
          returned unclaimed.
        \item The state could have resent the letter by regular mail or posted it
          physically at the address. (It should not be required, though, to hunt
          for Jones's contact information.)
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Justice Thomas, dissenting:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Process requirements must be determined ex ante. They should not be
          dependent on the outcome of the first attempt.
          state should take additional steps to give notice.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Contractual Consent to Jurisdiction: \emph{Carnival Cruise Lines, Inc. v. Shrute}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The plaintiffs, the Shutes, purchased tickets for a seven-day cruise through a travel agent. The cruise line, Carnival, sent the defendants the tickets by mail. The tickets included a contract that named Florida as the forum state for any litigation regarding the contract. By purchasing the tickets, the Shutes agreed to the terms of the contract.
    \item Mrs. Shute injured herself during the cruise by slipping on a mat. The Shutes sued in Washington for negligence. Carnival argued that (1) the forum selection clause in the contract requires the Shutes to bring suit in Florida, and (2) Carnival did not have sufficient contacts with Washington to allow its courts to exercise personal jurisdiction.
    \item The U.S. District Court for the Western District of Washington granted Carnival's motion to dismiss on the grounds that Carnival had insufficient contacts with Washington to exercise personal jurisdiction. The Court of Appeals reversed on the grounds that Mrs. Shute would not have been injured but for Carnival's solicitation of business in Washington. The Court of Appeals further held that the forum selection clause could not be enforced because (1) it was not freely bargained for, (2) the Shutes are physically and financially incapable of pursuing litigation in Florida, and (3) the clause violates the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act.
    \item Issues:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is the forum selection clause enforceable?
        \item Is it too inconvenient for the Shutes to pursue litigation in Florida?
        \item Does the forum selection clause violate the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act?
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Justice Blackmun:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item In their briefs, the respondents (the Shutes) conceded that they received adequate notice of the forum selection clause.
        \item Some forum selection clauses might not be enforceable, e.g., if they were established through ``fraud or overreaching.''
        \item In \emph{The Bremen}, the court upheld the validity of a forum selection clause in international admiralty between two commercial actors. The Court of Appeals applied \emph{The Bremen} in this case to hold that the forum selection clause was unenforceable because the parties had not negotiated it. The Supreme Court (Blackmun here) argued that the Shutes (individuals) did not negotiate with Carnival (large corporation).
        \item The lack of bargaining does not automatically invalidate the contract, however. There are plenty of reasons why a non-negotiated forum selection clause would be reasonable: (1) avoid litigation in every single passenger's different forum, (2) dispelling confusion about the proper forum, and (3) reduced fares resulting from the limited fora. Thus, the clause is enforceable.
        \item Re Florida as an inconvenient forum: Shutes have not satisfied the burden of proof to show heavy inconvenience.
        \item Re violation of the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act: no evidence that Congress intended to avoid having a plaintiff travel to a distant forum in order to litigate.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Justice Stevens, dissenting:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Only the most meticulous passenger will be aware of the forum selection clause.
        \item Passengers will not be able to evaluate the contract until they agree to it by purchasing a non-refundable ticket. Negotiation is not possible.
        \item Clause \emph{is} null and void under the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act.
        \item This is a contract of adhesion. The Shutes did not know or consent to all of its terms.
        \item Forum selection clauses are not enforceable if they were not freely bargained for.
        \item The forum selection clause makes it more difficult for the Shutes to recover damages for the slip-and-fall, which is contrary to public policy.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Holding: The Court of Appeals is overturned (i.e., the forum selection clause was enforceable; the forum was not inconvenient; and the clause did not violate the Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act).
    \item Rules:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Forum selection clauses can be enforced even if they were not freely bargained for.
        \item Plaintiffs have a high burden of proof to show that a forum is so inconvenient that it violated due process.
        \item The Limitation of Vessel Owner's Liability Act does not protect plaintiffs from traveling to distant forums to litigate their disputes.
    \end{enumerate}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Subject Matter Jurisdiction and Venue}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Federal courts have \textbf{limited jurisdiction}. Cases must be within their limited subject matter jurisdiction.
    \item The primary sources of limits on subject matter jurisdiction are Article III of the Constitution and a set of federal jurisdictional statutes.
    \item Unlike personal jurisdiction, subject matter jurisdiction \textbf{cannot be waived}.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Federal Question Jurisdiction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Article III authorizes the federal judiciary:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item ``...The judicial power shall extend to all cases, in law and equity, arising under this Constitution, the laws of the United States, and treaties made, or which shall be made, under their authority;---to all cases affecting ambassadors, other public ministers and consuls;---to all cases of admiralty and maritime jurisdiction;---to controversies to which the United States shall be a party;---to controversies between two or more states;---between a state and citizens of another state;---between citizens of different states;---between citizens of the same state claiming lands under grants of different states, and between a state, or the citizens thereof, and foreign states, citizens or subjects....''
        \item Federal judicial powers are \textbf{enumerated}---just like federal legislative powers. But unlike congressional power, the scope of the judiciary is narrowly construed.\footnote{Casebook p. 372 n. 2.}
    \end{enumerate}
    \item 28 U.S.C \S\ 1331 establishes federal question jurisdiction: ``The district courts shall have original jurisdiction of all civil actions arising under the Constitution, laws, or treaties of the United States.''
    \item States have concurrent jurisdiction over cases based on federal law unless Congress has provided for exclusive jurisdiction.\footnote{Casebook p. 373.}
    \item Federal courts have concurrent jurisdiction over state law cases as long as there is subject matter jurisdiction. Diversity is typically the basis for federal subject matter jurisdiction, though federal questions are also often involved.\footnote{Casebook p. 373--374.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Well Pleaded Complaint: \emph{Louisville \& Nashville RR Co. v. Mottley}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item September 1871: plaintiffs won a judgment against the railroad company that awarded them free rail passes for life.
        \item June 29, 1906: Congress passed a statute forbidding free passes or free transportation.
        \item January 1, 1907: the railroad company stopped honoring the plaintiffs' free pass.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item The Mottleys brought a contract action against the railroad in federal court, alleging that (1) the congressional statute does not cover their kind of pass and (2) if the statute did cover their kind of pass, it would violate the Fifth Amendment.
    \item The Supreme Court held that there was no subject matter question in this case. Both parties were citizens of Kentucky, so there was no diversity jurisdiction. The plaintiff's claim was based solely on a private contract, and although the plaintiffs anticipated a federal defense from the defendants, the court held that \textbf{an anticipated federal defense is not sufficient to establish federal question jurisdiction}.
    \item \textbf{Well pleaded complaint rule}: ``Plaintiff may not anticipate a federal defense by the defendant in her complaint and use that defense as a basis for federal jurisdiction.''\footnote{Casebook p. 378.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{The Kaleidoscope and the Welcome Mat: \emph{Grable \& Sons Metal Prods. v. Darue Eng. \& Manuf.}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 1994: The IRS seized Grable's land in Michigan to satisfy its tax delinquency. It notified Grable by mail and sold the property to Darue under a quitclaim deed.
    \item 1999: Grable brought a quiet title action against Darue in state court, claiming that Darue's title was invalid because the IRS failed to notify Grable with personal service as required by statute.
    \item Darue removed to federal court on the basis that Grable's claim depended on an interpretation of federal tax law. The district court declined to remand to state court. It granted summary judgment in favor of Darue, holding that the IRS had substantially (if not literally) complied with the statute.
    \item The Sixth Circuit affirmed the summary judgment. It held that jurisdiction existed because (1) the title claim raised an issue of federal law and (2) the claim implicated a substantial federal interest in construing federal tax law.
    \item The question before the Supreme Court was whether a federal cause of action is always required to establish federal question jurisdiction.
    \item Justice Souter:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Federal jurisdiction exists for state law claims if they ``implicate significant federal issues.''\footnote{Casebook p. 390.}
        \item The federal issue at stake must be substantial.
        \item District courts can refuse to exercise jurisdiction if the cause of action is not based on a federal question.
        \item Cardozo: ``a request to exercise federal-question jurisdiction over a state action calls for a `common-sense accommodation of judgment to [the] kaleidoscopic situations' that present a federal issue, in ``a selective process which picks the substantial causes out of the web and lays the other ones aside.''\footnote{Casebook p. 391.}
        \item ``...the question is, does a state-law claim necessarily raise a stated federal issue, actually disputed and substantial, which a federal forum may entertain without disturbing any congressionally approved balance of federal and state judicial responsibilities.''\footnote{Casebook p. 392.}
        \item The Court saw the absence of a federal cause of action ``not as a missing federal door key, always required, but as a missing welcome mat, required in the circumstances...''\footnote{Casebook p. 394.}
        \item Affirmed.
    \end{itemize}
    \item Justice Thomas, concurring:
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Justice Holmes in \emph{Merrill Dow} argued in his dissent that a federal cause of action should be necessary, not merely sufficient. Thomas argued that the current rule is unclear, and under the right circumstances he would be ``willing to consider'' adopting the clearer Holmes rule.\footnote{Casebook p. 395--96.}
    \end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Diversity Jurisdiction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Article III \S\ 2 defines federal judicial jurisdiction to include ``all Cases...between Citizens of different States...''
    \item 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1332 authorizes diversity jurisdiction. Federal courts have original jurisdiction over all cases where the amount in controversy is greater than \$75,000 and the parties meet the diversity requirements.
    \item One reason for establishing diversity jurisdiction was to protect out-of-state parties from prejudice in state courts.
    \item Unlike subject matter jurisdiction, which did not receive permanent congressional authorization until 1875, Congress immediately granted diversity jurisdiction.
    \item A plaintiff can aggregate multiple claims against a defendant to meet the amount in controversy requirement---however, a plaintiff cannot aggregate multiple claims against multiple defendants.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Complete Diversity: \emph{Mas v. Perry}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Mr. and Mrs. Mas were graduate assistants at LSU. They discovered that their landlord, Perry, had been spying on them through two-way mirrors for several months.
    \item The plaintiffs sued Perry in district court in Louisiana. Perry moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction on the grounds that (1) the plaintiffs failed to prove diversity jurisdiction and (2) the jurisdictional amount of damages was lacking. The district court rejected the motion.
    \item The Fifth Circuit held:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Mr. Mas was a French resident, so there was diversity jurisdiction for his claim under 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1332(a)(2) (``alienage jurisdiction'').
        \item Mrs. Mas was a domiciliary of Mississippi, so there was diversity jurisdiction for her claim under 28 U.S. \S\ 1332(a)(1). (Domicile is distinct from residency. Although Mrs. Mas resided in Louisiana, she was a domiciliary of Mississippi, so diversity was preserved. Domicile is established when a person intends to remain in a state indefinitely.)
        \item The amount in controversy well exceeded the threshold for federal jurisdiction (then \$10,000). The \textbf{\emph{St. Paul Mercury} rule} (or the ``legal certaint'' rule) requires defendants opposing jurisdiction to prove a ``legal certainty'' that the plaintiff could not recovery more than the statutory threshold (now \$75,000, then \$10,000).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Affirmed.
    \item \textbf{Complete diversity} requires that none of the plaintiffs can be from the same state as any of the defendants.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{The Corporate Nerve Center: \emph{Hertz Corp. v. Friend}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The plaintiffs brought an employment claim against Hertz in California state court. Hertz requested removal to federal court. The plaintiffs argued that Hertz was a California citizen and therefore that jurisdiction was lacking.
    \item 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1332(c)(1) provides that a corporation is a citizen of the state where it is incorporated \emph{and} the state where it has its principle place of business.
    \item Hertz argued that its principle place of business was New Jersey.\footnote{It is incorporated in Delaware.} The district court disagreed, relying on a Ninth Circuit precedent that defines a corporation's principle place of business as the state where the amount of business it conducts is ``significantly larger'' than other states. It remanded to the state courts. The Ninth Circuit affirmed.
    \item The Second Circuit rule was that a corporation's principle place of business is where its ``nerve center'' is located.\footnote{Supplement pp. 39--40.}. Courts have interpreted the test with increasing complexity. The Supreme Court here sought to establish a simple rule. Expanding on the ``nerve center'' approach, it held that the principle place of business is ``the place where a corporation's officers direct, control, and coordinate the corporation's activities.''\footnote{Supplement p. 41.}
    \item Under the Supreme Court's rule, Hertz's principle place of business was not California. Reversed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Supplemental Jurisdiction}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Supplemental jurisdiction allows a claim without jurisdiction to join a claim with valid jurisdiction.
    \item 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1367, passed in 1990, codified the federal common law of pendent and ancillary jurisdiction into the single concept of supplemental jurisdiction.
    \item Supplemental jurisdiction is \textbf{discretionary} (\S\ 1367(c)). 
    \item Evaluating supplemental jurisdiction cases:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Is there a claim with valid original jurisdiction?
        \item Do supplemental claims form part of the same case or controversy? 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1367(a).
        \item Are the supplemental claims within the \S\ 1367(b) rules? The supplemental claim against a third-party defendant is not allowed if (1) the original basis for jurisdiction is diversity and (2) the supplemental claim would destroy diversity. \S\ 1367(b) exists to prevent plaintiffs from bringing suit against diverse defendants and waiting for them to implead a non-diverse defendant who is the real target of the action.
        \item Can the court decide not to exercise supplemental jurisdiction? \S\ 1367(c).
    \end{enumerate}
    \item \emph{Gibbs} is preserved in \S\ 1367 as the ``same case or controversy'' requirement (\S\ 1367(a)).
    \item \emph{Kroger} is preserved in \S\ 1367 as the option for courts to decline to exercise supplemental jurisdiction if it dismisses all claims over which it has original jurisdiction (\S\ 1367(c)(3)). % TODO: for certain? what about 1367(b)?
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Common Nucleus of Operative Fact: \emph{United Mine Workers of America v. Gibbs}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Facts:
    \begin{enumerate}
        \item Spring 1960: The Tennessee Consolidated Coal company laid off 100 miners belonging to the United Mine Workers, Local 5881.
        \item Summer 1960: Grundy Company, a subsidiary of Consolidated, hired Gibbs to serve as superintendent for the opening of a new mine that would employ members of the Southern Labor Union. Grundy also awarded him a contract to haul the mine's coal to the railroad.
        \item August 15, 1960: UMW Local 5881 workers forcibly prevented the opening of the new mine, believing that Consolidated had offered them the jobs, not SLU. Gibbs lost his job as superintendent and never entered his contract.
    \end{enumerate}
    \item Gibbs sued UMW in district court under the Labor Management Relations Act, which established federal question jurisdiction. He also made a state law claim for interference with his employment and hauling contracts.
    \item The district court rejected the LMRA claim and the hauling contract claim, but it awarded damages for Gibbs for the employment interference claim.
    \item The key question before the Supreme Court was whether the district court ``properly entertained'' jurisdiction of the state law claim.\footnote{Casebook p. 410.}
    \item The Court held that federal courts can exercise supplemental [then, pendent] jurisdiction over state law claims if they arise from a ``common nucleus of operative fact'' with a federal claim.\footnote{Casebook p. 411.}
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{Claims against Multiple Defendants: \emph{Owen Equip. \& Erection Co. v. Kroger}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item James Kroger was electrocuted when the crane he was walking next to came too close to a power line.
    \item Mrs. Kroger (Iowa) brought suit in district court in Nebraska against the Omaha Public Power District (Nebraska) for negligence based on diversity jurisdiction. OPPD impleaded Owen under FRCP 14(a) as a third-party defendant. Kroger amended her complaint to assert a new claim against Owen directly. OPPD left the case when the court granted its motion for summary judgment, leaving only Kroger's direct claim against Owen.
    \item On the third day of the trial, Owen revealed it was also from Iowa, eliminating diversity jurisdiction. It moved to dismiss for lack of jurisdiction. The district court denied the motion and the jury found for Kroger. The Eight Circuit affirmed.
    \item Justice Stewart: Kroger's claim against Owen was independent from its claim against OPPD, even though they arose from a common nucleus of operative fact. Therefore, there was no supplemental jurisdiction, and there was no diversity jurisdiction because both parties were from Iowa. Reversed.
    \item Justice White, dissenting: Kroger did not deliberately circumvent the diversity requirement. Efficiency considerations weigh in favor of keeping the case in federal court. 
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Removal}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item 28 U.S.C. \S\ 1441 allows a defendant to remove a case from state to federal court.
    \item Only defendants can remove.
    \item Only state $\rightarrow$ federal. No federal $\rightarrow$ state.
    \item Removal does not expand federal subject matter jurisdiction.
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Caterpillar Inc. v. Williams}}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item The plaintiffs alleged that they entered into oral employment contracts with Caterpillar, which they claim it violated when it closed its San Leandro plant and laid off the plaintiffs. The plaintiffs sued for breach of contract in state court. Caterpillar removed to district court on the grounds that any individual employment contracts were superseded by collective bargaining agreements, for which LMRA preempted state law.
    \item The district court held that removal was proper. The Ninth Circuit reversed.
    \item The Supreme Court affirmed. It reasoned that the plaintiff's claim was based on a private contract dispute for which their was no subject matter jurisdiction in federal court. The well pleaded complaint rule prevented Caterpillar from removing to federal court solely on the basis of a federal defense.
    \item Affirmed.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{\emph{Forum Non Conveniens} and Transfer of Venue}

\begin{enumerate}
    \item todo
\end{enumerate}

\paragraph{\emph{Piper Aircraft Co. v. Reyno}} % TODO

\begin{enumerate}
    \item Six people were killed when a small plane crashed in Scotland. On behalf of the decedents, the plaintiff sued the aircraft manufacturer (Piper) and the propeller manufacturer in a California superior court. Piper successfully moved for transfer to the Middle District Court of Pennsylvania, pursuant to 28 U.S.C. §1404(a) (change of venue for convenience). Then, in district court, it moved to dismiss on the grounds of \emph{forum non conveniens}. The district court granted the motion, and the defendants agreed to submit to the jurisdiction of Scottish courts. The court noted several private interest and public policy reasons for moving the venue to Scotland.\footnote{Casebook p. 474--75. }
    \item The Third Circuit reversed the motion to dismiss, arguing (1) that the district court did not have the authority to review the policy reasons for dismissal, and (2) that dismissal is never appropriate when the law of the alternative forum is less favorable to the plaintiff.
    \item The Supreme Court rejected the Third Circuit on both questions. First, it held that differences in substantive law between two forums should never be a substantial factor unless the alternative forum is egregiously bad. Second, the it held that the district court did not abuse its discretion in weighing the public and private interests, on the basis that foreign plaintiffs deserve less deference in determining the convenience of a forum.
\end{enumerate}
